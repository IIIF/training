I hope you have enjoyed this workshop. This is the first time we have run a workshop aimed at working with IIIF rather than getting started with implementing IIIF and we would really appreciate your feedback. I would be grateful if you could fill in the following feedback form:

We have covered quite a few IIIF tools in this course but there are many more. A good place to start if you are looking for another type of tool is the IIIF Awesome list:
