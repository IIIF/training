# Annotations

Annotations are a core feature of IIIF and in this section we will start with looking at the basic theory before looking at how annotations work with one of the IIIF Tools called Mirador.

This will be followed by a annotation use case with the Welsh Book of Remembrance. 

Finally after the use case we will look at annotating your own Manifests with an Annotation server that we host for the training.
