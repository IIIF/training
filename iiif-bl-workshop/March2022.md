# Introduction

Thank you for signing up for the British Library IIIF Training between the 21st to 25th of March. This course has been adapted from the general online IIIF course for the British Library. 

The course will follow this GitBook and will be a mix of pre-recorded sessions and live presentations. This GitBook contains embedded videos and also exercises to follow. There are drop in sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and these are meant for the group to get together to discuss any issues or get questions answered. Live sessions will be recorded and sent to the group over email.

If you are new to IIIF you may want to watch the following video which gives you some ideas on what the IIIF standards can provide before starting the course:

## Sessions

The following sessions will set hands on work for participants to complete and are also an opportunity to ask questions. To allow the easier exchange of questions in the drop in sessions we are going to split the attendees into 3 groups. Group A, B and C. The first meeting on Monday and the last meeting on Friday will be for everyone.

## Project Work 
One of the most useful features of previous workshops have been where participants work on a project during the week which they can demo on the [last day](day-five/README.md). We are hoping to re-create this and we encourage participants to bring their own images and project ideas to the workshop. We will discuss them in the [first meeting](day-one.md) and will provide support during the workshop to produce a demonstration. Participants will be able to book time with a tutor for one on one advice and can also get help from others using a shared Slack channel. 

## Install Requirements
All sessions will use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and participants are encouraged to join the [IIIF Slack](http://bit.ly/iiif-slack) where a special channel will be created for workshop participants. 

I look forward to working with you and if you have any questions please donâ€™t hesitate to get in contact. 

Thanks
