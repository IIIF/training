##Â British Library involvement with IIIF
IIIF is a set of standards that provide access to high quality images and audio-visual content in a method that allows users to choose different viewers and tools to interact with cultural heritage content. It has been widely adopted by world leading organisations including the British Library. It provides a basis for users to gather digital content and enables research by comparing and annotating content. The IIIF standards are developed by an international open community and are supported by a consortium of institutions including the BL. 

The British Library has been involved with the development of IIIF since the very beginning and was instrumental in seeking and managing the grant which added audio-visual support to IIIF. It was also one of the eleven [founding members](https://iiif.io/news/2015/06/17/iiif-consortium/) of the IIIF Consortium. Members of staff at the BL have been active participants in the community providing advice on implementation and also funding tools that benefit both the BL and the wider IIIF community. One example is with the development of the [Universal Viewer (UV)](http://universalviewer.io/) which started life as the [Wellcome Viewer](https://wellcome.org/press-release/wellcome-librarys-digital-player-made-freely-available) before the BL funded work for it to become one of the most widely used IIIF viewers. By supporting financially the work of the [UV Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/universalviewer) the BL has enabled the addition of the A/V support in the UV along with numerous usability fixes. Some of the BL priorities for using IIIF include enabling 3D content and content enrichment both through crowdsourcing and machine learning, digital engagement and storytelling and discovery of our open access digitised newspaper collections.
