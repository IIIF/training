# IIIF A/V 

The IIIF Community has been working on adding support to IIIF for Audio/Visual resources. This is now possible in Version 3.0 of the IIIF API. I am going to go through the following presentation on [google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r-0Ffu8hbKGZdzP5hmYt1EZWu8Dl0AzSrTUTtRgm4c4/edit?usp=sharing).
