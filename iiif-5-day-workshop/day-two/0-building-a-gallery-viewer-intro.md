# Building a Gallery Viewer

## Goals

Our goal this morning is twofold.

* First we want to begin building a web environment where we can begin to use the IIIF image API in real world web pages.

* Second, in the process of building such a page, we want to begin to see *organically* the need for the IIIF presentation API.

## Activity Description

To achieve this, our goal this morning is to begin building our own rudimentary gallery viewer or image focused website: a gallery or site that provides a public viewing space for the images that you made IIIF compliant yesterday.

Hopefully, this can be the beginning of building a personal project that we will return to all week. By the end of the week, our goal is to connect (via links) all of our personal projects, producing a collection of projects that represents the achievement of our week together.
