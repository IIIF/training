# Ranges

Ranges allow us to provide nuanced navigation for object represented as a manifest.

## Activity

1. Find and download a manifest
1. Add a "structures" field to the manifest and then add ranges at least two levels deep following the IIIF specification
  * [http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/#range](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/#range)
1. Save your modified manifest as `manifest-with-ranges.json` in the `myManifests` folder on your Desktop.
1. Server your manifests and collections with `$ http-server --cors`
1. View your manifest in Mirador and navigate the resource via your ranges.
