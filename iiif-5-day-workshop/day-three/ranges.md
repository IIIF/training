# Ranges

Ranges allow us to provide nuanced navigation for object represented as a manifest.

## Activity

* Find and download a manifest
* Add a "structures" field to the manifest and then add ranges at least two levels deep following the IIIF specification
  * [http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/#range](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/#range)
* Change the id of your manifest to match the url from which it will be served (e.g. localhost:8080/mymanifest.json)
* Serve your manifest
* View your manifest in mirador and navigate the resource via your ranges.
