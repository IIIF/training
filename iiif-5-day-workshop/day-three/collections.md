# Collections

## Description 

#### Collection Tree Navigator for Mirador

This feature came about to address the need of showing objects in nested collections to ease navigation and avoid server slow-down. Collection-level manifests are often very large and can contain many sub-collections within them. As such, it became important for users to navigate through collections easily and without losing context. 

See the code for Collection Tree [here](https://github.com/utlib/mirador/tree/develop_collection_tree_lazy) 

Allows users to:

- View entire collections with sub-collections in a tree structure on manifest selection panel
- Easily navigate across collections
