# DCMI 2023 IIIF Workshop

This is part the [DCMI 2023](https://www.dublincore.org/conferences/2023/) IIIF Workshop.

## About the workshop

Access to image-based resources is fundamental to research, scholarship and the transmission of cultural knowledge. Digital images are a container for much of the information content in the Web-based delivery of images, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials. Yet much of the Internet's image-based resources are locked up in silos, with access restricted to bespoke, locally built applications. A large community of the world's leading research libraries and image repositories have embarked on an effort to collaboratively produce an interoperable technology and community framework for image delivery.

This workshop will introduce the basics of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) starting with demonstrating the use cases it supports; including side by side comparison, annotations and layering of images. It will then go on to look into the Image API and provide a method for participants to upload their own images to the Internet Archive so they can access the IIIF Image support the IA provides.

The second part of the workshop will focus on linking multiple IIIF images together with metadata to provide a IIIF Presentation API manifest and look at the different tools that are available to work with these manifests. Participants will create their own manifests and look to create an exhibit showing off their work.  

## Speaker Bios:

Tom Cramer is the Chief Technology Strategist, Associate University Librarian & Director of Digital Library Systems & Services for the Stanford University Libraries. He directs the technical development and delivery of Stanfordâ€™s digital library services, including digitization, management, preservation and access of digital resources that support teaching, learning and research. He is the founder of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), a founder of the Samvera Community, the first adopter and an active contributor to Blacklight, and a member of the FOLIO Community Council. He is the President of the Open Library Foundation and co-chair of the CLOCKSS Board of Directors. He has served as a co-PI for the suite of LD4L and LD4P grants from their inception to present day.

Simeon Warner is Associate University Librarian for IT and Open Scholarship at Cornell University Library. His responsibilities include oversight of IT operations, user experience, web programming, digital preservation, and open scholarly publishing. I have particular interest in interoperability between information systems and the development of standards and collaborations to facilitate that. Current work includes digital preservation (OCFL), evolution of the FOLIO library services platform, use of linked open data for description and discovery of library resources (LD4L/LD4P), image and A/V interoperability (IIIF), and repositories for open-access scholarly publishing (including work with Samvera and ORCID). Past projects include technical direction of the arXiv e-print archive and development of the OAI-PMH and ResourceSync standards.

## Contributor Bio:

Glen Robson works as the IIIF Technical Coordinator and runs a monthly 5 day online training course along with designing custom training for different institutions on IIIF and AV and reusing IIIF resources in various research systems like Omeka, Zooniverse and other annotation systems.
