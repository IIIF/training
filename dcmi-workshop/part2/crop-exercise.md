## Exercise: Cropping Images

In this exercise we will use the [UCD Image Cropping tool](https://jbhoward-dublin.github.io/IIIF-imageManipulation/index.html?imageID=https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/25286607) to select a region of a IIIF image (and optionally adjust other parameters), and see that the region can be be reused via its URI.

### Step 1: Start the Cropping Tool with an image

You can start the tool with any IIIF Image by appending the image identifier to the URL base `https://jbhoward-dublin.github.io/IIIF-imageManipulation/index.html?imageID=`

Examples include:
* A [Map of Seoul](https://collections.si.edu/search/detail/edanmdm:nmnhanthropology_8480110) in the [cropping tool](https://jbhoward-dublin.github.io/IIIF-imageManipulation/index.html?imageID=https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/NMNH-81-10767) (from Smithsonian)
* An [Emroidered Screen with 10 panels](https://collections.si.edu/search/detail/edanmdm:nmnhanthropology_8337004?q=korea+art&iiif.enabled=true&record=8&hlterm=korea%2Bart&inline=true) in the [cropping tool](https://jbhoward-dublin.github.io/IIIF-imageManipulation/index.html?imageID=https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/NMNH-NHB2017-00559-000003)

### Step 2: Explore selection of a region

Use the graphic region selection tool and experiment with the other parameters.

### Step 3: Use the cropped image

Look at item 4 within the cropping tool:
1. Preview the cropped image
2. Download the cropped image
3. Copy the cropped image URI into another browser tab to see how it could be reused by reference on any web page
