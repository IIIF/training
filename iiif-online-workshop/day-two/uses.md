## Uses of the Image API

The Image URL can be used in the same way as a normal image and has lots of practical uses.

Embedding on web pages:

![example iiif image](https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/25286607/full/,250/0/default.jpg)

A home teaching background for a menu:

[Smithsonian Record](https://collections.si.edu/search/detail/edanmdm:chndm_1980-32-1810-11?q=menu&iiif.enabled=true&record=116&hlterm=menu)

## Zoom Viewer:
The most common use case is to show the image in a viewer like OpenSeaDragon:

<iframe src="https://iiif.gdmrdigital.com/openseadragon/index.html?image=https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/25286607/info.json" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>


## National Museum of Sweden

Some places embed a IIIF Image into their content management system and it means they don't need to us the Presentation API. For example:

[Magistrate Heurlin's Residence Truveholm in Västergötland](http://emp-web-84.zetcom.ch/eMP/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=26240&viewType=detailView)

## Geo-referencing:

The [georefrencer.com](https://www.georeferencer.com/) tool is another example which works just with the Image API.
