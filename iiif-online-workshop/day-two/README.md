# Day 2 - Image API
## Tuesday

The second day of the workshop will focus on the IIIF Image API. Participants may find it helpful to have the video open at the same time as the workshop webpages as the video takes you through these pages.  

### Image API session - 1 hour  
Glen Robson the IIIF Technical Coordinator will introduce you to the IIIF Image API starting with the background before going into showing examples of how it works. 

During the call participants will be given a guided hands on task to create their own IIIF images. At a minimum by the end of this topic participants should have their own images available through the Internet Archive. These images will then be used in the next stage with the Presentation API.
