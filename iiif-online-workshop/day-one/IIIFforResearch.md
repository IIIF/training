# Using IIIF for research

## Quick review

### Two APIs we'll focus on today
* Image API

#### Quick Exercise: go to [https://www.learniiif.org/image-api/playground](https://www.learniiif.org/image-api/playground) and manipulate the test image

* Presentation API

"Manifest" - this is the bundle of information that IIIF relies on to enable sharing of books and manuscripts across viewers and institutions

## Finding IIIF Materials "in the wild"

How we encounter IIIF materials at various repositories varies widely. Explore some of the collections below to get a sense of what steps you might need to go through to find IIIF material to work with.

* OCLC IIIF Explorer (experimental): [https://researchworks.oclc.org/iiif-explorer/](https://researchworks.oclc.org/iiif-explorer/)
* Bayerische StaatsBibliothek: [https://app.digitale-sammlungen.de/bookshelf/](https://app.digitale-sammlungen.de/bookshelf/)
* Stanford Special Collections: [https://bit.ly/stanford_iiif](https://bit.ly/stanford_iiif)
* Biblissima (aggregates many European libraries): [https://iiif.biblissima.fr/collections/](https://iiif.biblissima.fr/collections/)
* The Vatican: [https://digi.vatlib.it/](https://digi.vatlib.it/)
* Harvard: [https://library.harvard.edu/digital-collections](https://library.harvard.edu/digital-collections)
* Many, many more: [https://bit.ly/iiif_collections](https://bit.ly/iiif_collections)

#### Quick Exercise:

* Open an instance of Mirador 2 - [this one, for instance](http://dms-data.stanford.edu/data/mirador_cropper/example.html) or [this one](https://projectmirador.org/demo/)
* Find an item from the collections listed above that you might be interested in exploring further
* Find the IIIF badge and drag it into Mirador, or use the IIIF manifest URL and add it to the Mirador workspace
* As a point of comparison, use the same IIIF manifest URL and add it to the [Universal Viewer](https://universalviewer.io/)
* Note: Different software for different user experiences, same source content

## The Basics: Zooming and Comparison

We're going to continue to use the Mirador Viewer, version 2, for this example, though version 3 would work as well if you prefer that - see the [Mirador 3 demo site](https://mirador-dev.netlify.app/__tests__/integration/mirador/)

Many research uses simply call for being able to zoom in to specific details, which nearly all of the IIIF viewers do by default. Side-by-side comparison is another basic research need.

#### Quick Exercise:
* Using one of the Mirador demo sites listed above, build a workspace view that compares two or more manuscripts.

## Creating Annotations

There are many ways to create annotations in IIIF. One of the simplest ways to start is to use Mirador to create "commenting" or "transcription" annotations. 

A very nice example of the use of these kinds of annotations can be found at the Vatican: https://spotlight.vatlib.it/humanist-library

#### Quick Exercise
* Using the Mirador example you worked with previously, add some simple annotations to your object

## Using Annotations to Drive a User Experience

Another way to use annotations and images together for research or teaching purposes is with tools developed to guide a viewer through a curated experience. We'll talk about various tools to do this over the course of the week, but for today let's look at one approach developed by CogApp.

* CogApp: Storiiies - [http://storiiies.cogapp.com/](http://storiiies.cogapp.com/)
* Storiiies Editor: [https://storiiies-editor.cogapp.com/](https://storiiies-editor.cogapp.com/)
* Example: [https://storiiies.cogapp.com/viewer/aeqi/The-Stoning-of-Saint-Stephen](https://storiiies.cogapp.com/viewer/aeqi/The-Stoning-of-Saint-Stephen)

## Transcriptions are a Kind of Annotation

For this section, we'll look at using IIIF to support transcription projects using [FromThePage](https://fromthepage.com/)

Example: 
* [La Sfera Challenge](https://lasferachallenge.wordpress.com/)
* [La Sfera at FromThePage](https://fromthepage.com/stanfordlibraries/the-international-la-sfera-challenge)
* [La Sfera Results in Mirador](https://dms-data.stanford.edu/data/build/lasfera.html)

## Questions to pursue this week
* How do we save and host annotations and research outputs?
* How do we credit contributors?
* How do we notify others when new annotations are published?
* Others?
