### Day 3: Storiiies – a free online storytelling platform for everyone
Guest lecture by Andy Cummins, Cogapp

Take people on a journey round your images. Pan, zoom and annotate points of interest. Whether you are telling the story of an Old Master painting, exploring the cover artwork of your favourite album or teaching a remote cohort the intricacies of an ancient papyrus, Storiiies enables clear, elegant and engaging online storytelling.

In this presentation Andy Cummins from Cogapp will demonstrate both the editing and viewing experience of Storiiies enabling all attendees to begin creating their own stories.
