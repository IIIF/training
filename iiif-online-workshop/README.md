# Introduction

This workshop was held during the week of the 8th to 12th of June 2020 and 30 people attended from across the world. The workshops materials and videos are now available for you to follow along at your own pace. If you have any questions about any of the activities or get into difficult you can get help from the IIIF community using the [IIIF Slack](http://bit.ly/iiif-slack), particularly the `beginners` channel. At the end of this workshop there is a survey and we would be grateful if you could fill it in so we know how it went. 

The workshop is split into 5 different areas which were split into 5 days: 

 * Day 1 - [IIIF Basics](day-one/README.md)
 * Day 2 - [Image API](day-two/README.md)
 * Day 3 - [Presentation API](day-three/README.md)
 * Day 4 - [Annotations](day-four/README.md)
 * Day 5 - [Project demos](day-five/README.md)

All of these sessions were recorded and you will find them embedded in the relevant sections. The first video to watch is mentioned below.
