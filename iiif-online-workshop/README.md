# Introduction

Thank you for registering for the [IIIF Online Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/iiif-online-workshop-tickets-104699503032) between the 8th and 12th of June. This course is an adapted version of an in person workshop we have run over a number of years but this is the first time we have run it online. Demand for this workshop has been high and we have a long waiting list so if after seeing the plans below you don’t feel able to attend please let me know at [glen.robson@iiif.io](mailto:glen.robson@iiif.io) so we can re-distribute your ticket. 

We are keen to adapt many of the techniques that have worked in person to create an inclusive, productive online version of the workshop. Running an online version does have its complications and one of these is differing timezones and we have participants from Europe, North and South America. To accommodate this the sessions are at a time that works for most people but will be late for Europeans and early for West coast Americans. We also appreciate during this time attending all of the sessions will be difficult and so only the [first](day-one/README.md) and [last](day-five/README.md) sessions are mandatory. The other sessions will be recorded and will be more useful if you can attend and ask questions but they can also be viewed at other times.The schedule of core sessions is as follows:

## IIIF Online Week - June 1st - June 5th
Some of the core sessions will include prerequisite videos to watch before attending the core session and for the introduction session on Monday the 8th we would like you to watch one of the introductory sessions ([IIIF Week: Introduction to IIIF (Option A)](https://iiif.io/event/2020/iiifweek/#iiif-week-introduction-to-iiif-option-a) or [IIIF Week: Introduction to IIIF (Option B)](https://iiif.io/event/2020/iiifweek/#iiif-week-introduction-to-iiif-option-b)) which are part of the [IIIF Week](https://iiif.io/event/2020/iiifweek) next week. You can either attend the session live next week by registering on the following page:

https://iiif.io/event/2020/iiifweek/ 

or we will also send a recording of the session for you to watch. This will give you an intro to IIIF and hopefully some project ideas we can discuss in the session on Monday June 8th. All IIIF Online events are free to attend and the following sessions may be of interest:

 * IIIF Week Opening Panel: Responding to Current Events with Digital Collections Strategy
 * IIIF Week: Museums Showcase
 * IIIF Week: Mirador 3 Showcase
 * IIIF Week: Maps Showcase
 * IIIF Week: IIIF and Manuscript Use Cases
 * IIIF Week: Fun with IIIF

## Project Work and tutor groups
One of the most useful features of previous workshops have been where participants work on a project during the week which they can demo on the [last day](day-five/README.md). We are hoping to re-create this and we encourage participants to bring their own images and project ideas to the workshop. We will discuss them in groups in the [first meeting](day-one/README.md) and will provide support during the workshop to produce a demonstration. Workshop participants will be split into groups lead by a tutor who will provide support and ideas for projects. Participants will be able to book time with tutors for one on one advice and can also get help from others using a shared Slack channel. 

Detailed install requirements will be sent next week but all sessions will use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and participants are encouraged to join the [IIIF Slack](http://bit.ly/iiif-slack) where a special channel will be created for workshop participants. 

I look forward to working with you and if you have any questions please don’t hesitate to get in contact. 

Thanks
