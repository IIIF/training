# Introduction

This workshop is part of a regularly run online workshop and you can see the next available session by scrolling to the bottom of the [IIIF Consortium events page](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/iiif-consortium-19836883937). You are also welcome to go through these materials independently and if you any questions about any of the activities or get into difficult you can get help from the IIIF community using the [IIIF Slack](http://bit.ly/iiif-slack), particularly the `beginners` channel. At the end of this workshop there is a survey and we would be grateful if you could fill it in so we know how it went. 

The workshop is split into 5 different areas which were split into 5 days: 

 * Day 1 - [IIIF Basics](day-one/README.md)
 * Day 2 - [Image API](day-two/README.md)
 * Day 3 - [Presentation API](day-three/README.md)
 * Day 4 - [Annotations](day-four/README.md)
 * Day 5 - [Project demos](day-five/README.md)

All of these sessions were recorded and you will find them embedded in the relevant sections.
