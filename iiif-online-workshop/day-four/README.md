# Day 4 - Annotations
## Thursday

The fourth day of the workshop will focus on the annotations. Participants may find it helpful to open the video in a separate window so they can follow the workshop web pages at the same time.  

### IIIF and Annotations - 1 hour  

Glen Robson the IIIF Technical Coordinator will introduce you to annotations and IIIF by using an annotation server and looking into the IIIF Search API. This will be a live demo on the 24th of September.
