# 2 hour IIIF Training

This training was first developed for a [VRA](https://www.vraweb.org) workshop on IIIF and then further refined for the [Digital Heritage 2025](https://digitalheritage2025.unisi.it/program-overview/). 

## About the workshop 
Access to image-based resources is fundamental to research, scholarship and the transmission of cultural knowledge. Digital images are a container for much of the information content in the Web-based delivery of images, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials. Yet much of the Internet's image-based resources are locked up in silos, with access restricted to bespoke, locally built applications. A large community of the world's leading research libraries and image repositories have embarked on an effort to collaboratively produce an interoperable technology and community framework for image delivery.

This workshop will introduce the basics of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) starting with demonstrating the use cases it supports; including side by side comparison, annotations and layering of images. It will then go on to look into the Image API and provide a method for participants to upload their own images to the Internet Archive so they can access the IIIF Image support the IA provides. 

The second part of the workshop will focus on linking multiple IIIF images together with metadata to provide a IIIF Presentation API manifest and look at the different tools that are available to work with these manifests. Participants will create their own manifests and look to create an exhibit showing off their work.  

## Speaker Bio:
Glen Robson works as the IIIF Technical Coordinator and runs a monthly 5 day online training course along with designing custom training for different institutions on IIIF and AV and reusing IIIF resources in various research systems like Omeka, Zooniverse and other annotation systems. Glen has been involved in the IIIF community since 2014 and previously worked at the National Library of Wales and worked on their IIIF implementation to support various crowdsourcing, maps and Newspaper projects.
