While looking through the GRI collection I noticed a number of Maps which is a good excuse to demonstrate one of the new tools available for IIIF maps.  For this example I am going to use this map of Paris:

Using the detektIIIF tool discussed previously we can use this map in the following Geo-referencing tool:
