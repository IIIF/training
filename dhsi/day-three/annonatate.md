8. Choose from one the options that appears.
    Add to My Images: it will add the image to My Images so it will continue to appear so you can use it.
    Make Copy: (This only appears if the URL is a manifest): This will create a copy of the manifest in your workspace. This is handy if you want your annotations list URLs added to your manifest automatically.
    View: will allow you to view the image in the annotation viewer without adding it to the My Images section.
