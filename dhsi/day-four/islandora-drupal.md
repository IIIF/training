# Islandora/Drupal 

<a href="https://islandora.ca/ ">Islandora</a> is an open-source software framework designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework. Islandora makes use of <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, a scalable, open platform for web content management and digital experiences, as the presentation layer for collections.

Similar to Omeka, both Islandora and Drupal have a module-based structure that allows users to customize their site depending on need. At present, there are over 40,000 Drupal modules that touch on a range of needs such as interface design, analytics, metadata and libraries. 

See here for a full list of Drupal moduel see: https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module?page=3 

Islandora also has a large number of modules and can be seen here: https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_awesome .


At the University of Toronto, Drupal is used heavily for websites and Islandora for digital collections. As weâ€™ve moved towards implementing IIIF library-wide it became necessary to ensure Islandor/Drupal could work with IIIF in some capacity.
