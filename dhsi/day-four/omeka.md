Omeka is very popular in the heritage sector to create digital exhibits and collections, in digital humanities classrooms to explore digital accessibility, metadata and digital scholarship, and in research as a means to manage data.

You can see some sites using Omeka here: http://omeka.org/classic/showcase/ 

At the University of Toronto we have built a series of plugins to integrate IIIF with Omeka in a way that also interacted with other popular plugins (ex. Exhibits, Neatline, Tags etc.). Our user group, mostly medievalists, indicated they want to make use of IIIF viewer functionality - pan, zoom, colour change etc. - as well as annotation. 


### Plugin: IIIF Toolkit

<b>Scenario:</b> I want to use IIIF content from mine or other institutions to annotate, present, edit and maintain in a way that is useful to me and my research.

IIIF Toolkit allows users to ingest IIIF content, view content in the Mirador image viewer, annotated images, re-order/edit canvases and use them in online exhibits along with non-IIIF material. In addition, the plugin allows the Exhibits plugin to reference external manifests without ingesting them into Omeka at all.

### Plugin: Batch Upload

<b>Scenario:</b> I have DIY images (jpeg/tiff/png) that I want to store and manage somewhere. I also want to be able to use a IIIF viewer and annotate my images.

The Batch Uploader allows users to upload image files and metadata from their desktop in bulk into Omeka. At the same time, the plugin generates a manifest for the images on the fly so they can be viewed in Mirador and annotated.
