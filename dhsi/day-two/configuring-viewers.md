## Configuring Viewers

Now that we've spent the day learning about the IIIF Presentation API and creating our own manifests, we thought it would fun to do a deeper dive on the use of IIIF Image Viewers. 

Specifically, we want to show you how we can not only add our manifests to existing viewers, but we can actually highly customize these viewers in a way tailored to our specific needs. 

For example:

* If you're running museum exhibit, you might want a viewer that provides a guided curation of specific images and limits how the user can interact with the collection
* If you're building a research environment, you might want to use the viewer different to allow users to control every aspect of their environment.
* If you're trying to illustrate a research outcome, you might want to bring the users to a very specific place within a set of images.

There are many options here. We're going to focus on two highly customizable viewers: Mirador and Universal Viewer. First, we're going to look at how to embed a viewer in your own project (to do this, we'll continue to use or "Custom Image Viewers" projects). Then we'll walk through several of the configuration option. Then we'll turn this into a work period, where you can start embedding a viewer into your project and adjust the configuration settings as needed. We'll come around and help you customize your project any way you want.
