### Takeaways
The presentation API allows you to tie IIIF Images together to create a digital presentation of the resource. It allows you to:

 * Link multiple images in a particular order e.g. a Book, Newspaper or Manuscript
 * Add Basic descriptive Metadata
 * Add Rights information
 * Link to other digital objects
 * Add Table of Contents etc.
 * Based on the linked data vocabulary [Shared Canvas](https://iiif.io/model/shared-canvas/1.0/)
