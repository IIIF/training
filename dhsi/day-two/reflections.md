# Some Reflection Questions

* What kind of NON-image data do you need to make your “viewer” work?
* What kind of labels and descriptions do you need?
* What kind of data relationships are needed in order to make it work?
  * (For example sequence: what comes first, what comes last, what comes next?)
* What were the pain points of making an image viewer this way?
* What felt repetitive?
* Were there features you built that you wanted to re-use but couldn't? How come?
