## Prepare your own edm-iiif files

To create an edm-file using iiif, please copy-paste the [edm-iiif template file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hAiXhP2MdnJZPbmBG8hcaKLwAHnuCADi-m0hAVYubp0/edit) into your favourite xml editor and fill it out.
```
* Yellow: link to the image(s) in the repository that you created in part 1 of this workshop
* Green: insert your metadata
* Orange: insert your rights statements (!Make sure your rights statements are valid, if you are unsure, leave the default.)
```
* Save as .xml
* Zip
* Upload in Sandbox

## A quick Sandbox how-to
For many extra features, advanced instructions can be found in the [Metis Sandbox User Guide](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2104295432/Metis+Sandbox+User+Guide)


### Goals of the Sandbox

The Metis Sandbox is a test environment for your data. It consists of a set of tools with which you can:

1. simulate ingesting and running the Metis workflow on your data,

2. see what your records would look like on the actual [Europeana.eu](https://www.europeana.eu/nl) portal,

3. get insight into the quality of your records.

### Focus of today: running & what would it look like

* Prepare zip-file using your own edm-iiif files (see above)
* Navigate to the [Sandbox](https://metis-sandbox.europeana.eu/) 
* Create new dataset: fill out the short form
* Press the ‘submit’ button
* Wait 15 minutes to ‘view published records’

## Try for yourself!
* Instructions: follow the indicated steps
* Fiona & Lianne are available for questions
