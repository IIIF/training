# National Library of Wales Training

## Brief
The National Library of Wales is looking for a two day on-site training with day one to cover the basics of the Image API, Presentation API and annotations. Day two should include a half day on Audio Visual support for IIIF and half a day looking at tools and implementations and then an open discussion on future directions for the NLW IIIF support.

## Hands on IIIF Workshop
The staff of the IIIF Consortium are working with the NLW to provide a custom 2 day training introducing the benefits and opportunities of using IIIF. Where possible examples will be provided using NLW content and participants are encouraged to identify NLW content they can use through the workshop. 

The workshop is intended to give a hands-on experience of working with IIIF images, Manifests and AV resources. No prior technical or IIIF knowledge is required and all the tools will be made available using a Web Browser like Chrome or Firefox. You will be asked to register for a free Github account, instructions will be provided.
