## National Library of Wales Manifests

The NLW are in an usual position in that all of the collections are made available as IIIF. Generally the way to access a IIIF Manifest is the same once you get to the NLW Viewer. This exercise is to look at how researchers use your collections and how they can re-use manifests. 

## Catalogue 

To access most items in the collection its possible to use the catalogue at [discover.library.wales](https://discover.library.wales/). Questions:

 * Is there a way to get access to all digital collections? 

Once you find a digital item, usually the clue is a thumbnail: 

![View item in catalogue](imgs/day-one/catalogue.png)

You can access the viewer and then by clicking on the link icon you can get access to the IIIF Manifest:

![Viewer](imgs/day-one/viewer.png)

![Viewer IIIF logo](imgs/day-one/viewer2.png)

Examples include:
 * [Oswestry Development Plan map - https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/1489984/manifest.json](https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/1489984/manifest.json)

The URL or Web address to the Manifest is not specified by IIIF but the NLW implementation is made up of the following:

```
https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/1489984/manifest.json
```

 * **https** this is important as all IIIF manifests and images need to be https to allow re-use. We will discuss this later.
 * **damsssl.llgc.org.uk** hostname or the machine that has copies of the images and manifests. Note dams.llgc.org.uk is the http version
 * **iiif/2.0** IIIF version of the manifest and image. This is to allow future implementation of version 3 or 4 of IIIF. 
 * **1489984** the Fedora PID of the parent object. 
 * **manifest.json** This is the name of the IIIF manifest and by convention is `manifest.json` but it could be called anything. 

## Exhibitions

Another way of finding digital content is through the exhibition route. Once you find an item:

![Exhibition](imgs/day-one/Exhibition.png)

You can view the manifest by clicking on the link icon and right clicking on the IIIF manifest:

![Exhibition Viewer](imgs/day-one/Exhibition_viewer.png)

 * [The Hengwrt Chaucer -  https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4628556/manifest.json](https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4628556/manifest.json)


## Places 

For the places website once you have navigated to an area and clicked on a pin you can access the map or apportionment:

![Cynefin](imgs/day-one/cynefin.png)

Which will take you to the viewer which you can again click on the share button to access the IIIF manifest:

![Cynefin Viewer](imgs/day-one/cynefin_viewer.png)

 * [Map of the parish of Henfynyw in the County of Cardigan - https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4527504/manifest.json](https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4527504/manifest.json)

## Journals 

The Journals website also uses the Universal Viewer to show IIIF items but note the Manifest will be for the Journal Issue rather then the Journal Title. 

![Journals](imgs/day-one/journals.png)

 * [The Cambrian quarterly magazine and Celtic repertory - https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/2070799/manifest.json](https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/2070799/manifest.json)

 To get to a Journal title we can look at the following link:

[https://journals.library.wales/view/2070008/2070799/65#?xywh=-2243%2C-198%2C6731%2C3949](https://journals.library.wales/view/2070008/2070799/65#?xywh=-2243%2C-198%2C6731%2C3949)

In this example:
 * **2070008** the first PID is the title pid
 * **2070799** is the issue PID

We can then access the title Collection using the following:

 * [The Cambrian quarterly magazine and Celtic repertory - https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/2070008/manifest.json](https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/2070008/manifest.json)

## Newspapers

There isn't a public IIIF link for the Newspapers as this was before the NLW implemented IIIF but the NLW newspapers do use IIIF images. 

![Newspapers](imgs/day-one/newspapers.png)

There are hidden IIIF manifests which were used for prototyping for example:

Title: https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/newspapers/3036868.json
Issue: https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/newspaper/issue/3036869/manifest.json

Note the Newspaper title manifests donâ€™t generate for some titles but this one works well as its a small title:

https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/newspapers/3100020.json

There are some issues, the main one is the https versions linked above contain http IIIF images which causes them not to work in most viewers. 

## Archives

During the implementation of the WW1 archive a number of Archive records were made available as IIIF. These were then indexed for the [Cymru 1914 - http://cymru1914.org](http://cymru1914.org) website. 

These manifests and collections are interesting as it replicates the full hierarchy of the original archival cataloguing. Unfortunately they won't work in viewers as they are all from http links:

 * [Fonds for Cardiganshire Great War Tribunal (Appeals) Records](http://dams.llgc.org.uk/iiif/archive/3975658/fonds.json)
